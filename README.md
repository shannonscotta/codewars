## Kata #1 (https://www.codewars.com/kata/64e0622b2e4b274c01133ffb)
## Welcome to the "Pet Pawty" Challenge!

Your mission is to create a function for our doggo party that returns `true` if the input is valid or the corresponding string if it is invalid.
Please note that valid dog names are strings within an array.

## Scenario:

- **If the input is invalid:** <br>Return: `"This is not a list of dogs."`
- **If no dogs:** <br>Return: `"Aww man, no dogs?"`
- **If only one dog:** <br>Return: `"A proper party needs more than just [dogName]!"`
- **If less than five dogs:** <br>Return: `"We need more than [dogCount] dogs for a pawty!"`
- **If more than 25 dogs:** <br>Return: `"Woah [dogCount], that's a lot of dogs! Let's keep it reasonable."`
